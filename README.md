## OBJECTIVE
let's suppose you went through few videos on a platform which you liked and wanted more videos with similar concept, music or may be any thing liked about that video. But now without any video recommendation algorithm you won't be able to enjoy them furthur. Here, this algorithm helps the user in understanding their feed and keep suggesting them similar concept videos. and keep them engaged and learn more about the stuff they are interested in.

## Setup:

### **1. Setting Up the Environment**

Tools and Libraries:
```
Python
Flask or FastAPI (for APIs)
pandas, numpy (for data handling)
requests (for API calls)
scikit-learn (for model building)
SQLAlchemy or pymongo (for database integration)
```
installing required libraries:

```
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn requests pymongo

```

### **2. Fetch Data via APIs**
The first step is fetching data using the APIs provided.


### **3. Data Preprocessing**

Steps:
Combine Data: Merge data from different API responses into a single dataframe.
Handle Missing Values: Fill missing values with appropriate defaults.
Feature Engineering: Create features like engagement_score or trending_score.

### **4. Cold Start Problem**

For new users:

Use mood: Match the userâ€™s mood with video metadata (e.g., tags or categories).
Trending Content: Recommend videos with the highest trending_score.

### **5. Recommendation Algorithms**

Content-Based Filtering:
Calculate similarity between video metadata (e.g., tags, categories).


###   **6. API Development**
Develop endpoints to serve recommendations.
```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from preprocess import preprocess_data
from recommendation import content_based_recommendations

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/feed', methods=['GET'])
def get_feed():
    username = request.args.get('username')
    category_id = request.args.get('category_id')
    mood = request.args.get('mood')

    # Replace with actual logic
    recommendations = [{"post_id": "123", "title": "Sample Video"}]
    return jsonify(recommendations)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)


```

### **7. Model Evaluation**
Using the metrics like MAE, RMSE, and CTR to evaluate the model.
